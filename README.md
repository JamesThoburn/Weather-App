# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App!

## About
This is a website in which the user can search for a location and data relating to the weather is then displayed. Due to relevancy, I chose to pick for the following to be displayed after searching:
- Location name
- Temperature (°C)
- Description of the weather
- What temperature it feels like (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (KMPH)

## Features
- **Search Bar:** Search for a location and its data appears, if an invalid input is given then the website alerts the user as to it with a "City not found" message.
- **Displaying data about a location:** Shows the name, temperature, description, temperature feel, humidity and wind speed, all in metric system.

## Technologies Used
